# Multithreading in Java

## Description
This Java program demonstrates multithreading by creating two threads:

1. `NumberThread` prints numbers from 1 to 10.  
2. `SquareThread` prints squares of numbers from 1 to 10.  

Both threads run concurrently and share a counter variable. Synchronization is used to safely update the shared counter.

---

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:

```bash
javac MultithreadingReport.java
Run the program:
java MultithreadingReport
Sample output:
Number: 1 (Counter: 1)
Square: 1 (Counter: 2)
Number: 2 (Counter: 3)
Square: 4 (Counter: 4)
